name: about

Hi there! I'm Jasdeep and this would be my website where you can find some
of my coding [projects](/projects/).

I graduated Cornell University in May 2012 with a Bachelor of Science degree,
majoring in computer science and picking up minors in both pure and applied
mathematics. I'm employed as a software engineer at
[Nebula](http://www.nebula.com), working on private cloud technologies.
Previously, I interned at [Qualcomm](http://www.qualcomm.com) and
[STMicroelectronics](http://www.st.com).

I'm always down for a good discussion about anything, but I'm particularly
interested in technology, sports, politics, and policy.

Reach me by email at <i>jasdeep 'DOT' singh 'DOT' hundal 'AT' gmail 'DOT' com</i>
(yeah, that's pretty long and ugly)
or through [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jasdeephundal).

Thanks for visiting!
