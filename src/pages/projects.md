    - name:         Plannit
      description:  >
            Plannit is a tool used to plan lunches and dinners with friends.
            It takes everyone's food preferences and location and returns
            the best places to eat with a bit of help from the Yelp API.
            I worked with <a href="http://www.sohanjain.com">Sohan Jain</a>,
            <a href="http://www.harryterkelsen.com">Harry Terkelsen</a>,
            and <a href="http://www.gautamkamath.com">Gautam Kamath</a> to
            build it in < 24 hours for the 2011 Cornell Facebook Hackathon,
            winning 2nd place.

    - name:         Ezra Tower Defense
      description:  >
            Ezra Tower Defense is a multiplayer tower defense game where
            the enemies are generated by users poking you on Facebook.
            We used Node.js and now.js for the game internals and
            raphael.js for the frontend graphics.
            I worked with Sohan and Harry again, with
            <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sung-min-sam-park/41/908/a12">Sam Park</a>
            joining our team for the 2012 Cornell Facebook Hackathon,
            winning 1st place and earning us trip to the College Hackathon
            Finals.

                    The website you are seeing right now was constructed
                    using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> and
                    <a href="http://packages.python.org/Flask-FlatPages">Flask-FlatPages</a>
                    to dynamically set the content.
                    <a href="http://packages.python.org/Frozen-Flask">Frozen-Flask</a>
                    was then used to generate a set of static pages which are now
                    hosted on Google's App Engine.
