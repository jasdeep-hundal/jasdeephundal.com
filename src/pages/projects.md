            Plannit is a tool used to plan lunches and dinners with friends.
            It takes everyone's food preferences and location and returns
            the best places to eat with a bit of help from the Yelp API.
            I worked with <a href="http://www.sohanjain.com">Sohan Jain</a>,
            <a href="http://www.harryterkelsen.com">Harry Terkelsen</a>,
            and <a href="http://www.gautamkamath.com">Gautam Kamath</a> to
            build it in < 24 hours for the 2011 Cornell Facebook Hackathon,
            winning 2nd place.
